iPolarized - Polaroid app for iPhone
---

Functionaity:
0. You load the app
1. You take a picture
2. You say if you want to use that picture
3. Program converts picture to polaroid
4. Saves the picture to camera roll
5. You quit app and start over.

Todo:
Fix 5
Allow to convert pics from photo library.
The way the photos show up is a bit iffy, i.e. the dimensions are fucked up on
    the app itself. Look fine in photo library.

This code is copyright under gpl3 so all you bastards who want to resell
it for money have to release your code. Frankly I don't care if you resell
it, but make the code open or I'll send Richard Stallman after you!!!
